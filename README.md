### Capstones
- `Experimental Design with A/B testing. Smoking and Birth Weight:` As data scientists at a large healthcare organization, we constantly strive to find ways which can improve human health and longevity. During an annual meeting of maternal health, a couple of members from the audience asked if there was a data-driven method of finding factors that impact the health of newborns. A couple of pregnant women were smokers and asked if smoking would negatively impact the health of their unborn children. Interested in answering this question analytically, we decided to use a data-driven approach through A/B testing.
- `Supervised Learning: Predicting Land and Ocean temperatures in the US:` We have over a century's worth of historical global temperature averages, encompassing global land and ocean temperatures as well as maximum and minimum global temperatures, at our disposal. Given that we have both the features and the target variable for prediction, this falls under the domain of supervised learning. Because the target variable is continuous, the task takes is that of regression. Multiple regression models are exposed to both features and targets during the training phase, and they are tasked with learning how to effectively map the data to make predictions.
- `Unsupervised Learning: Classifying Shopping Mall Customers:` We are data scientists for a large supermarket with regional brands in shopping centers. We receive basic information about our consumers, such as age, gender, annual income, level of education, and city size, via membership cards. We are also provided a customer spending score, which is something you allocate to the consumer depending on characteristics you set, such as customer behavior and purchasing data. We want to know who our target customers are so that we can develop an accurate strategy for the mall's marketing team. To do this, we will use both hierarchical and partitional clustering algorithms.
- `Natural Language Processing and LLMs:` To be completed.
