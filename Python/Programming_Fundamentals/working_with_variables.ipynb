    "## Creating and referring to variables in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two distinct moments to think about when working with variables in Python: assigning a value to a variable, and retrieving the value from a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assign a value to a variable, use the assignment operator `=` with the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_name = \"Johnny Robot\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code says that the value of the variable `my_name` is `\"Johnny Robot\"`, and that information is stored in memory. You could update the value of `my_name` by adding another line using the assignment operator. For example, you could add a line that says `my_name = \"PJ Harvey\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the `=` operator is assigning a value to a variable, not asserting that two different values are equal. When you see the `=` character in mathematical statements, it's an equals sign, and it means that the values on both sides are equal. For example, `2 + 2 = 4` is a perfectly reasonable mathematical statement. But that's not how `=` works in Python.\n",
    "In Python, the `=` character is an operator that assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left. Trying to execute the line of code `2 + 2 = 4` in Python will give you a syntax error because you can't *assign* anything to the value `2 + 2`. Mixing up the math usage of `=` with the programming usage of `=` is one of the most common errors for beginner programmers, and it's one that you will probably make several times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the value in a variable, just refer to the variable in your code. This example would print a greeting that accesses and uses the value of `my_name`:\n"

    "\n",
    "The names that you choose for variables are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some rules about how variable names *must* look in order for the Python interpreter to recognize that your code is talking about a variable in the first place. And there are also stylistic conventions about how you *should* name your variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The naming requirements in Python are simple:\n",
    " 1. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore.\n",
    " 2. The remainder of your variable name may include letters, numbers, and underscores.\n",
    " 3. The variable name cannot be a *reserved word*.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the following are valid variable names:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Guido\"\n",
    "favorite_painter = \"Mondrian\"\n",
    "__password__ = \"hunter7\"\n",
    "job1 = \"Programmer\"\n",
    "job2 = \"Benevolent Dictator\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "*(Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, held the position of Benevolent Dictator for Life of the programming language until stepping down in 2018.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the variable names below is invalid and will raise a syntax error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Variable name doesn't start with a letter or underscore:\n",
    "1st_name = \"Guido\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variable name includes a disallowed character: `-`:\n",
    "my-password = \"hunter2\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variable names can't be keywords like `else`:\n",
    "else = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reserved words* are a special category of words that you're not allowed to use as variable names in a given programming language. For example, in Python, you can't reassign the name `True` or the word `def` to a new value. See the documentation for the full list of [33 reserved words](https://docs.python.org/3.5/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the syntax rules above, there are also recommended best practices that you *should* follow. Ignoring these recommendations won't cause your code to break, but it will make your code look strange to other Python developers and make it harder to maintain. [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) contains most of the relevant Python style recommendations. Here are a few important ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Use snake case**: Python developers generally use lower case with underscores (which is sometimes called *snake case*) for variable names. For example, `this_is_snake_casing`. A Python variable name should have lowercase letters throughout, with words separated by an underscore (`_`) character. There are cases where you may use TitleCasing ([with classes for instance](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#class-names)) or ALLCAPS ([for constants](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#constants)), but the general rule is to use snake casing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Choose meaningful variable names**: When you choose variable names in Python, choose names that describe the underlying value and reflect how the variable gets used in the program. A well-chosen variable name can help other people reading the code to understand how the variable is intended to be used. For example, full words are generally better than single characters or abbreviations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bad:\n",
    "p = 0\n",
    "n = \"Guido van Rossum\"\n",
    "b_btls = 99\n",
    "\n",
    "# Good:\n",
    "position = 0\n",
    "name = \"Guido van Rossum\"\n",
    "beer_bottles = 99\n",
    "```\n",
    "Naming variables is [more of an art than a science](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html), and you'll get better at it over time. But as a general rule of thumb, the more your code reads like an English sentence, the better you've chosen your variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional resources on style issues, you can dive into [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and follow it up with this fantastic talk on PEP 8 and good practices by Python contributor [Raymond Hettinger](https://medium.com/@drb/pep-8-beautiful-code-and-the-tyranny-of-guidelines-f96499f5ac17#.y7fi2ew7h).\n"
