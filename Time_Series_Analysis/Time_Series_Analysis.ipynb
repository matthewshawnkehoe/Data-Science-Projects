The data could just be a sequence of variables that are understood to have happened over time. This is typically called a process.

        "\n",
        "Next, you'll crystallize the definition of a stochastic process by considering its simplest example: the Bernoulli process. A Bernoulli process is a set of independent and identically distributed random variables, each one following a Bernoulli distribution. Now, break that definition down piece by piece.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, there is *independent*. By now, the idea of independence should be familiar to you; it means that the outcome of one observation does not affect any other outcome. *Identically distributed* means that each random variable is drawn from the same distribution. These two traits are very important to stochastic processes; often, you'll see \"independent and identically distributed\" abbreviated as iid.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Bernoulli distribution is one of the simplest distributions in statistics. In a Bernoulli distribution, the outcome has only two possible values, `1` and `0`, occurring with a probability of `p` and `1-p` respectively. The most common example of a Bernoulli distribution is a coin flip. A coin flip with a fair coin is said to be Bernoulli(`0.5`), with `0.5` as the value of `p`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, revisit the definition of a Bernoulli process, which is simply a series of outcomes from a Bernoulli distribution. Again, the most common example of a Bernoulli process is a series of coin flips, which would look something like `{0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1}`.\n",
        "\n",
        "If given a Bernoulli process, you can take its average value as an estimate of `p`, and then use a random generator to simulate the process further. So with the coin-flip values given above, `p=7/16`. Then you could simply randomly generate more `0` and `1` values, giving a probability of `p` to `1` and appending the values to your set as you continue.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Random walks\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, if Bernoulli processes are the simplest stochastic processes, then random walks are the next logical complication. A random walk is defined as the sum of iid random variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "To build an intuitive understanding of what a random walk is, think about someone walking along a path. The person starts at brick `0`, the bricks in front of them are numbered `1`, `2`, `3`, and so on, and the bricks behind them are numbered `-1`, `-2`, `-3`, and so on. With each step that the person takes, there is some constant, random probability that they will step forward (`+1`) or backward (`-1`). A random walk would be the path of the bricks that the person walks. `{0,1,2,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,4,5,6}` is a random walk. So is `{0,1,0,-1,-2,-1,0,1,0,1}`.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the random distribution of a step is Bernoulli with `1` and `-1` as the outcomes, then it is called a *simple random walk*. And if the `p` of that Bernoulli is `0.5` and the step values are `1` or `-1`, then it is a *symmetric simple random walk*, because the probability of going in either direction is symmetrical.\n",
        "\n",
        "Random walks are thought of as occurring in *discrete time*, meaning that there are specified steps where the process moves, rather than a smooth and continuous progression.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another extension of the random walk is the Wiener process, also called *Brownian motion*. In this process, the step, or the direction to its next position, is normally distributed. Note that the standard normal distribution has an expected value of zero. In stochastic processes, having an expected value of zero is an important characteristic because it means that the future value of the process is actually expected to be wherever the process is currently. These processes are called *stationary*. If it is expected to deviate from its current position, that is called *drift*.\n",

        "\n",
        "Where will you see these in the wild? You'll see them all the time. When you're tracking a single object or entity over time, the observed values can be thought of as a stochastic process. The object or entity moves randomly in some direction over time, and that randomness is stochasticity. For example, purchases by a customer over their lifetime is a stochastic process. So is the price of a stock.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you define these time series in terms of their stochastic characteristics, it allows you to model and often predict what they are going to do next.\n",
